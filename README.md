# BearPath - Your Trusty Campus Map

BearPath is a live, responsive campus map website for the University of Alberta that generates hidden indoor routes through pedways and walkways. It provides users with the most efficient routes between classes, simplifying navigation while minimizing contact with the freezing temperatures outside - especially useful during Edmontonâ€™s long unforgiving winters.

## Inspiration

The idea for BearPath arose from the need for a comprehensive campus map that includes indoor pedways and walkways during the winter months. Recognizing this gap, especially amid the University of Alberta community's demand, we embarked on creating a solution that would make navigating the campus smoother and more efficient.

## Demo

BearPath is hosted here: https://bearpath.up.railway.app/

Feel free to check it out and play around with it!

## What's Next

1) Add an option to search for routes with an emphasis on either indoor or outdoor paths.
2) Enable users to generate optimized routes based on their course schedules.
3) Enable an option to generate optimized paths based on current weather conditions. 
4) Crowdsource locations of microwaves, pianos, and, bathrooms to enable directions to them.
5) Integrate a live heatmap of foot traffic on various paths.
